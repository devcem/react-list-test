# react-list-test
React project

## Details
+ Elements are objects in array, we can't combine them with plus operator in JS. We need to use array join function to render in order.
+ Everything is a variable, somehow it doesn't work like traditional HTML.
+ If we use variables, we have to use it like this : onClick={this.addItem}
+ Seperated component file also should contain import react on head.
+ We need ReactDOM function to re-render.
+ Enclosing tags is important.
+ System forces us to use ES6 features.

## Also need to clarify
+ What is constructor?
+ What exactly main App, return and render functions
+ React renders everything in immutable mode. Check this link out : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object

## What's next?
+ Write these codes without documentation, make sure you understand everything.
+ Put select, checkbox and other input types, work with them.
+ Put delete button for todo app.
+ Work with routes, create seperated pages.
+ Understand UI states in react.
